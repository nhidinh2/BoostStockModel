1. Install xgboost 

cd into this project

git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost.git
cd xgboost
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

1. Edit the Makefile to include the correct paths for:

LIBPATH: Path to Strategy Studio's library files.
INCLUDEPATH: Path to Strategy Studio's header files.

i.e: 
LIBPATH = /usr/local/strategystudio/libs
INCLUDEPATH = /usr/local/strategystudio/includes

2. 
- Move these files (`.cpp, .h, Makefile`) into Strategy Studios
- Wscript file `compile_backtest.sh` that compiles the strategy, moves the strategy output file to the desired location in Strategy Studio, and start the backtest command line in Strategy Studio. 
- When Strategy Studio finishes backtesting, our script would then export these files into `.csv` files.
